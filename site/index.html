            San Juan submarine: 'Explosion' detected in hunt for Argentine vessel

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
The Argentine navy says an event consistent with an explosion was recorded near where a submarine disappeared last week with 44 crew on board.
The information came from an Austria-based anti-nuclear test watchdog, Capt Balbi said.
The new information was provided to the Argentine navy on Thursday by the Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), Capt Balbi said.
On Wednesday the navy received a US report of a "hydro-acoustic anomaly" detected hours after the submarine went missing.
Capt Balbi said the suspected explosion took place near the submarine's last known location.
The navy only knew the location of the suspected explosion, not its cause, he said.

            Myanmar Rohingya crisis: Deal to allow return of Muslim refugees

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
Bangladesh has signed a deal with Myanmar to return hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who fled a recent army crackdown.
Aid agencies have raised concerns about the forcible return of the Rohingya unless their safety can be guaranteed.
The Rohingya are a stateless minority who have long experienced persecution in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
More than 600,000 have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh since deadly Rohingya attacks on police posts prompted a military crackdown in Rakhine state in late August.
On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Myanmar's military action against the minority Rohingya population constituted ethnic cleansing.
Senior Myanmar official Myint Kyaing said it was ready to receive the Rohingya "as soon as possible".

            Rwanda offers refuge to enslaved Libya migrants

            <p class="summary-content">
Rwanda has offered to give refuge to around 30,000 African migrants stuck in Libya often in enslaved conditions.
Hundreds of thousands of Africans travel through Libya every year as they try to make their way to Europe.
"Rwanda, like the rest of the world, was horrified by the images of the tragedy currently unfolding in Libya, where African men, women and children who were on the road to exile, have been held and turned into slaves," the foreign ministry statement said.

            Australian paramedics fulfil dying woman's wish to go to the beach

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
A terminally ill woman in Australia has been granted her final wish to go to the beach by paramedics in Queensland.
The moment which was shared on social media by the Queensland Ambulance Service shows a paramedic standing beside the woman in her hospital bed.
The pair are seen looking out at the water at Hervey Bay, a coastal city in southern Queensland.
Hervey Bay officer-in-charge Helen Donaldson said a crew was transporting a patient to the palliative care unit of the local hospital when the woman expressed how she wished she could "just be at the beach" instead.

            Deep fat fryers may help form cooling clouds

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
Fatty acids released into the air from cooking may contribute to the formation of clouds that cool the climate, say scientists.
Fatty acid molecules comprise about 10% of fine particulates over London, and such particles help seed clouds.
But researchers dismiss the idea that cooking fats could be used as a geo-engineering tool to reduce warming.
Instead, the research is designed to help reduce uncertainties about the role of cooking fats on climate.
These aerosols persist for longer than normal and can seed the formation of clouds which experts say can have a cooling effect on the climate.

Facebook plans to let people see if they had "liked" pages created by "foreign actors" to spread propaganda during the US presidential election.
The Internet Research Agency was behind hundreds of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts and posted thousands of politically-charged messages.
In November 2016, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said it was a "pretty crazy idea" to suggest misinformation spread on the social network influenced the US presidential election.

A group of Indian farmers say they woke up shocked to find that the train they were travelling on had sped 160km (99 miles) in the "wrong direction".
But several hours into their journey, the group realised that the chartered train was not following the agreed route.
The farmers said that the train was due to reach Maharashtra via Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat states, but the route had been changed without their knowledge.
At around 4am, we realised that the train had reached the central state of Madhya Pradesh, which wasn't on our agreed route," Sagar Shambhushete, who was on the train, told the BBC.

A man who almost died after suffering burns on 95 per cent of his body is now in recovery thanks to a skin graft from his twin brother, French doctors say.
He arrived at hospital in critical condition with deep burns and within a week had received the first skin graft from his twin.
His burnt skin was removed and he received thin layers of skin from his brother Eric's scalp, back and thighs, which were stretched "like fishnet stockings", the surgeon told Le Monde newspaper.

Zimbabwe must act quickly to dig its economy out of a hole and access international financial aid, the International Monetary Fund has warned.
Government spending and foreign debt are too high and it needs structural reform, Zimbabwe mission chief Gene Leon told Reuters news agency.
"The economic situation in Zimbabwe remains very difficult," Mr Leon told Reuters.
He said high government spending should be reined in and Zimbabwe should address the large international debt it has defaulted on.

Moderate coffee drinking is safe, and three to four cups a day may have some health benefits, according to a large review of studies, in the BMJ.
It found a lower risk of liver disease and some cancers in coffee drinkers, and a lower risk of dying from stroke - but researchers could not prove coffee was the cause.
Too much coffee during pregnancy could be harmful, the review confirmed.
The University of Southampton researchers collected data on the impact of coffee on all aspects of the human body, taking into account more than 200 studies - most of which were observational.

Two men stranded for five days in a remote part of Australia were forced to the roof of their bogged vehicle to avoid rising tides and even a crocodile, police say.
Charlie Williams, 19, and Beau Bryce-Morris, 37, were on a fishing trip with a dog in Western Australia on Friday when their car became stuck.
He told the BBC the men had survived by rationing food and water, but they had run out of supplies when they were found on the Dampier Peninsula, about 100km (60 miles) north of the city of Broome.

            When I look into my son's eyes I see the man who raped me

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
Catherine, who lives in the UK, became pregnant after being raped by a man she had considered her friend.
She explains here why she decided to give birth to the child - and why the hardest thing for her is looking into her son's eyes.
I was a single parent with two children.
I knew him.
We had been friends for about two years, we met through a mutual friend and just had a friendship - a normal friendship, nothing more than that.
I'd been quite open with him that I wasn't looking for a relationship of any sort - I wanted to be on my own - and that I was happy to have a friendship.
I felt him get too close to me in a way that I just really wasn't comfortable with and I moved away and I went to push him back and it was very quick and very forceful.
I didn't really fight any more, it was like a freeze as opposed to trying to fight him.
I was injured, I didn't realise quite how much until afterwards but I think you go almost into auto-pilot.
I felt that because I knew him, it didn't really count as rape in the same way as if I had been attacked by someone who was walking down the street.
I said that I'm pregnant and it's your baby, expecting him to say, "Well no it isn't," not expecting him to acknowledge that it was.
People in the playground were quite judgmental when they realised I was pregnant but knew I was single, and I wasn't giving any explanation of why I was pregnant.

            Analysis: Will South Africa's ANC learn from Mugabe's fall?

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
The silence of South Africa's governing African National Congress (ANC), especially in the hours immediately after the fall of Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, was deafening.
When the ANC finally commented almost 24 hours later, it applauded the military for ensuring a "smooth transition" and said it continued to respect Mr Mugabe's role as a "freedom fighter".
In contrast, the main opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) reacted swiftly, capturing the mood of many black and white South Africans when it said: "This is a victory for the people of Zimbabwe who have suffered greatly under the latter years of Mugabe's reign.
"A once liberator of his people, Mugabe brought division, instability, and economic ruin to Zimbabwe as he made the unfortunate transition from liberator to dictator.
" But this applies not only to Mr Mugabe, but to also to the party he led Zanu-PF, which has dominated Zimbabwe since sweeping to power at independence in 1980.
A former intelligence chief who has used the state apparatus to tighten his grip on power, South Africa's President Jacob Zuma is a central figure in a faction campaigning to install his ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, as the next president, leading South Africans to draw parallels with Zimbabwe.
As South Africa's respected newspaper columnist Max Du Preez wrote: "Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma is no Grace Mugabe and isn't married to Zuma any longer, even if she still [or again?
" In racially charged rhetoric similar to that of Mr Mugabe, the Zuma-led ANC faction has condemned "white monopoly capital", has demanded land expropriation from whites without compensation and has warned of Western plots to oust the party.
As Mr Mugabe said in August 2017: "I asked one of the ANC ministers, how come whites have been left with so much power and he said: 'It was because of your friend Mandela, he is the one who made mistakes.
'" It matters little to them that South Africa's economy could collapse, like Zimbabwe's did after Mr Mugabe adopted policies that struck fear in the hearts of white Zimbabweans and Western investors.

            'Sexist' inclusive writing row riles France

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
The French, as is well known, are obsessed by one thing - language.
The latest topic to consume a nation of lexicologists is "inclusive writing".
This is the attempt to erase all trace of sexism in a language where gender is a central feature - French nouns are either masculine or feminine, dictating all adjectives and some verbal forms (a point that is sometimes made painfully clear to foreigners who happen to get those wrong).
French people now often talk about "la juge" or "la ministre".
In French, 10 sisters and one brother are collectively "heureux" - happy in a masculine way.

            The unknown Indian woman doctor on Google Doodle

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
Google surprised Indians on Wednesday, when it published a Google Doodle of Rakhmabai Raut, one of British India's earliest practising women doctors, to commemorate the 153rd anniversary of her birth.
This had many in India asking who was Rakhmabai Raut?
Raut became a doctor when modern medicine was in its infancy, which is noteworthy.
Raut was born in Mumbai (then Bombay) in 1864.
Undeterred, Raut took her husband to court, where the two were engaged in a long legal battle over the status of their marriage.

            Rihanna backs a teen sex victim jailed for murder

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
The tale of a 16-year-old killer is spreading around the world, after some of the planet's most famous women joined a campaign to free her.
Cyntoia Brown was sentenced to life in prison in 2004 for shooting dead Johnny Allen, a 43-year-old Nashville estate agent who picked her up for sex.
The teenager who went home with Mr Allen that night had been repeatedly raped and beaten.
She was on the streets by order of her boyfriend, described as a violent, drug-addled pimp named "Kutthroat", who she said verbally abused her and made her strip at gunpoint.
He had demanded that she make him some money.
The client who would become Cyntoia's victim showed her his gun collection, telling her he was a former Army sharpshooter.
Cyntoia ate dinner with him, watched some TV, and got into his bed.
Cyntoia said she panicked, thinking he was reaching for a gun.

            Philippine anti-drug agency chief vows 'rule of law'

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
The new chief of the Philippines' anti-drug agency has promised a fresh approach to the controversial war on drugs, "based on the rule of law".
Thousands have died in the anti-drug campaign since it was launched by President Rodrigo Duterte in 2016.
In October 2017, Mr Duterte ordered that the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) take over from the police as the sole agency in charge of the war on illegal drugs, Mr Duterte and the Philippine National Police (PNP) claim there have been no unlawful extrajudicial killings by officers under the current government, and say any suspects killed by officers were resisting arrest.
But when asked by the BBC why he thought the PNP had been removed from leading anti-drugs operations, Mr Aquino said: "The PNP were removed from this war on drugs precisely because there are some issues against them.

            Paloma Faith: 'I feel less fragile'

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
"I feel more powerful and more capable than I was before.
I feel so much less fragile, so much more resilient.
" Curled up on a sofa in the penthouse suite of a London hotel, Paloma Faith is in good spirits.
She's two hours away from turning on Regent Street's Christmas lights - "It's one of those things I didn't know I wanted to do until I was asked" - and 10 hours away from the release of her fourth album, The Architect.
" The record certainly has a lot to live up to: all of Faith's albums have gone double platinum in the UK.
She admits to "a few nerves" over the new record but, at the time of writing, The Architect looks certain to replace Taylor Swift's Reputation at the top of the charts.
The 36-year-old says she feels rejuvenated and energised after giving birth to her first child last year - even though she experienced a "terrible delivery" which temporarily left her with limited mobility and mastitis.
"I feel really motivated," she says, while admitting it's been "hard to come back" to the limelight.
The demands of her job means Faith will miss a lot of bath times this year - something she finds particularly difficult, while realising many working parents face the same dilemma.

            The female tech bosses who want zebras not unicorns

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
Zebras fix what unicorns break.
That's the motto of a new movement in the tech industry frustrated by Silicon Valley's lust for so-called unicorn companies.
A unicorn is a start-up valued at more than $1bn (£750m) - Facebook is a classic unicorn.
The zebra movement was launched earlier this year by four female founders who struggled to find funding for their tech start-ups.
The entrepreneurs wrote a manifesto calling for Silicon Valley to invest in more female and ethnic minority founders, and to back new companies from such backgrounds that want to be both profitable and improve society - zebras - instead of chasing mythical unicorns.
Aniyia Williams is a co-founder of the zebra movement.
She was tired of her headphones being tangled up and lost in the bottom of her bag, and imagined a better, more stylish way to wear her technology.
Aniyia, who is 32 and African American, says she thinks too many investors in Silicon Valley are missing opportunities to be part of profitable, sustainable companies because they're chasing things that aren't real - unicorns.

            North Korean defector: What dramatic footage tells us

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
Extraordinary footage of the recent defection of a North Korean soldier across the border to the South has been released.
On 13 November the soldier drove up to the border within the Joint Security Area (JSA) and then sprinted to the other side, a hail of bullets following him.
The UN Command, which oversees the military forces supporting South Korea, said the footage showed clear violations of the armistice brokered after the Korean War, with North Korean soldiers firing across the border and crossing the demarcation line.
North Korean guards reach him just seconds after he flees from the vehicle once it crashed and proceed to fire at him from very close range.
In his vehicle, the soldier zooms past what appears to be a North Korean checkpoint, driving right up to the border before getting out and simply running across to the South.
Even the North Korean checkpoint did not appear to have a gantry barrier.
But this can be traced back to the original purpose of the JSA as defined by the armistice, Yang Uk, a senior researcher at the Korea Defense & Security Forum, told BBC Korean.
" It was originally laid out more ambiguously, but a 1976 skirmish known as the "axe murder incident", when North Korean soldiers killed US soldiers trimming a tree, resulted in new rules where both countries' militaries had to keep to their side.
The North Korean defector soldier crashes his vehicle after a wheel apparently comes off.
