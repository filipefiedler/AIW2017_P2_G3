            Mount Agung: Bali volcano activity prompts 'red warning'

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
Airlines have been issued a "red warning" about the danger of volcanic ash in the skies close to Bali after Mount Agung emitted a thick plume of smoke reaching 4,000m (13,100 feet).
The red warning means an eruption is forecast to be imminent, with significant emission of ash likely.
Authorities have begun distributing masks in some areas as ash falls.
The ash cloud is said to be moving eastward from Bali towards the island of Lombok, and the main international airport there has been closed entirely.

            Archbishop of York ends decade of protest over Mugabe

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
The Archbishop of York has put on a dog collar for the first time in almost 10 years, ending his symbolic protest over Robert Mugabe's leadership of Zimbabwe.
In December 2007, Dr John Sentamu cut up his dog collar live on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, promising not to wear one until Mr Mugabe left office.
On Sunday, he returned to the Marr Show and reinstated his collar as promised.
Mr Mugabe left office dramatically on Tuesday after 37 years of authoritarian rule.

            'No Irish border deal before trade talks'

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
There can be no final decisions on the future of the Irish border until the UK and the EU have reached a trade agreement, Liam Fox has said.
The UK's international trade secretary also blamed the EU for Brexit delays.
The EU has said "sufficient progress" has to be made on the Irish border before negotiations on a future relationship can begin.
Downing Street has said the whole of the UK will leave both the customs union and the single market when it leaves the EU in 2019.
"We don't want there to be a hard border but the UK is going to be leaving the customs union and the single market," Mr Fox told Sky News.

            Islamabad protests: Pakistan's army says it is ready to help

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
Pakistan's army says it is "fully ready" to assist the government in dispersing Islamist protesters blocking a highway in Islamabad.
The government asked the military to help restore order after police failed to disperse demonstrations on Saturday.
However, the military's statement appears to criticise the government's handling of the situation, saying police had not been properly utilised.
On Saturday, the government suspended private news channels and blocked certain social networks - including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram - out of concern that live coverage of the police action could inflame religious sentiments.

            UK drone users to sit safety tests under new law

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
Drone users in the UK may have to take safety awareness tests under new legislation planned by the government.
Police will also be given new powers to seize and ground drones which may have been used in criminal activity.
The union's general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: "These proposals are a step towards the safe integration of drones, but until the new rules are in place the threat of a serious collision remains.
Drone pilot and trainer Elliott Corke, director of HexCam, said most recreationally and commercially-used drones in use weighed more than 250g, apart from the cheap toy versions.
He told BBC News that many new users were surprised by how many rules around drone usage already exist, under the Civil Aviation Authority's Drone Code.

            Railway stops worth lingering at

The golden age of rail travel appears to be well and truly over, and stations lack the glamour formerly associated with letting the train take the strain.
Commuters on the daily grind tend to be grimly determined when leaving a train.
The only reason to pause is to grab a cardboard cup of something caffeinated before stalking out into the ice-spiked drizzle of a dark winter's morning.
What if there was a station garden filled with fragrant shrubs, or an art gallery, or a top-notch local restaurant?
Here are some everyday railway stations with added extras you may wish to linger at - or even arrive early for.

But since 2012, many elderly nuns in Ladakh have found a home at the Chattnyanling nunnery built by the Ladakh Nuns Association with the help of local villagers.

            Century-old US riot only now being talked about

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
It's almost 100 years since 19 African-American soldiers were executed following a violent mutiny in Texas.
The figure corresponded to noose number seven which was used to hang him and another 12 African-American soldiers beside the Salado Creek of San Antonio in December 1917.
The executions followed the rainy August night when more than 100 armed soldiers marched into the city of Houston and during a two-hour riot killed 16 whites, including five policemen.
A total of 118 enlisted black soldiers were indicted, with 110 found guilty, 19 hanged and 63 receiving life sentences.
" In the spring of 1917, Moore and his unit, the 3rd Battalion of the predominantly black 24th United States Infantry had been dispatched to Houston to guard the construction site of a new camp following the United States declaring war on Germany.
"They sent these soldiers into the most hostile environment imaginable," says Charles Anderson, a relative of Sergeant William Nesbit, another of the hanged soldiers.
"There was Jim Crow law [which denied black people equal rights], racist cops, racist civilians, laws against them being treated fairly in the street cars, while the workers building the camp hated [the soldiers'] presence.
Although he was later released, a rumour reached Camp Logan that he had been killed, coupled with talk of a white mob approaching the camp - there was none - resulting in soldiers grabbing rifles and heading into downtown Houston.
I am sentence to be hanged for the trouble that happen in Houston Texas altho I am not guilty of the crime that I am accused of but Mother it is God's will that I go now and in this way and Mother I am going to look for you and the family if possible I will meet you at the river.
"The soldiers were 100% wrong for rioting, but I don't blame them," says Jules James, the great-nephew of Captain Bartlett James, one of the battalion's white officers who managed to restrain a larger number of soldiers from leaving camp.

            Can US generals say 'no' to a nuclear strike?

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
The claim: US military personnel could resist President Trump if he ordered an illegal nuclear strike.
Reality Check verdict: Although normally nobody is allowed to refuse the president's order, in practice, generals would expect a good explanation for the strike - and would be obliged to say "no" to an illegal order.
In recent months, with tensions rising between the US and North Korea, people have been asking what's to stop President Trump launching nuclear weapons.
Now, Gen John Hyten, who leads US Strategic Command, has told the Halifax International Security Forum that he would advise against a strike if he considered it was illegal.
But is anyone allowed to say "no" to the president if he orders a nuclear strike?
If President Trump wanted to fire nuclear weapons, he could first discuss a range of options with his advisers.
But Peter Feaver, professor of political science at Duke University in North Carolina, says it's not true that President Trump could launch a nuclear strike as easily as he could fire off a tweet.
" Prof Feaver says that if the president went to the military to order a strike, this would trigger a "consultation process" - generals wanting to know what the president was trying to achieve, why the president wanted to use nuclear weapons and so on.

            Mosque attack horror 'will work against extremists'

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
Friday's attack on a Sinai mosque was Egypt's deadliest in recent history, with over 300 people killed.
Middle East analyst HA Hellyer looks at the significance of the target and the likely consequences.
The intensity of this Friday's attack in Sinai is unprecedented in modern Egyptian history - never before have so many people been killed in such a short time by any terrorist group.
Regrettably though, this is not the first time that a mosque has been targeted by radical extremists.
The targeting of the mosque is quite likely to have something to do with that - as is the reportedly vocal opposition of villagers to radical groups.

Dame Jacqueline is being awarded the Special Award at the Bafta Children's ceremony on Sunday.
Dame Jacqueline started her career as a journalist for DC Thomson in Scotland and was one of the founders of Jackie magazine.
Many of Dame Jacqueline's books - like The Story of Tracy Beaker, Girls in Love and The Illustrated Mum - have been adapted into TV series and films.
Dame Jacqueline says when adaptations of her work win awards, she feels like a "fairy godmother".
" When other children's fiction authors were writing about wizards, teenage secret agents and Ancient Greek demi-gods, Dame Jacqueline was writing about bullying, abusive parents and the care system.
While it's probably something she's heard many times before, Dame Jacqueline reacts with gratitude when told that her books have helped children come to terms with what's going on in their lives.

            Pakistan protests: The political tensions behind the scenes

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
The situation in Islamabad had been simmering for three weeks before it erupted into violence on Saturday.
Many blame the government for allowing the protesters to grow in number and build a countrywide momentum for their movement.
The police failed to arrest leaders of the protest, and when trouble started to spill into other cities, they resorted to a controversial policy of blocking all live news channels and social media websites.
But the situation is not unprecedented in a country where the constitutionally elected civilian authority has found the rug being pulled from under its feet every two to four years.
Since Mr Sharif's party, PMLN, has considerable standing with right-wing religious voters in Punjab province, many believe the protest by the ultra-right-wing Tehrik Labbaik Ya Rasool-ul-Lah (TLYRA) is aimed at attracting some of that support towards itself.

            Journalists 'between the stick and the gun'

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
More than a dozen towns, cities and districts in Pakistan's restive province of Balochistan have been without newspapers for the past month.
In October, the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), a banned separatist group, issued an angry ultimatum to local journalists, whom they blamed for collaborating with the media wing of the Pakistan Army.
Balochistan, in the west of Pakistan, has been the scene of a long-running nationalist insurgency.
Foreign journalists need to seek special permission to visit the majority of the province, while the Pakistani media is often wary of reporting on what is considered to be one of the most sensitive issues in the country.
According to the International Federation of Journalists, 29 media workers were killed in the province between 2007 and 2015.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, local reporters told the BBC that earlier this year they had been warned by civil and military authorities in the province they would not "tolerate the version of militants in newspapers.
But the BBC spoke to members of 18 different press clubs in areas dominated by the Baloch ethnic group who said they all remained closed, with no newspapers being delivered at all - suggesting distributors aren't working in about half the province.

            Why donkeys are a reminder of one island's sweet old days

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
Early morning visitors meander around the Vivian Richards stadium in Antigua.
In fact, the pastoral surrounds of the legendary cricketer's eponymous venue are a popular hangout for the island's donkeys too.
Once the lifeblood of the sugar industry, these gentle equines helped put the Caribbean country on the map well before the "Master Blaster".
They can also be seen careering through crops, gate-crashing gardens, or just plodding serenely along roads in their constant hunt for food.
The decline of the sugar industry, and increase in modern transportation, may have rendered Antigua's donkeys redundant but that has done little to curtail their population.
Today, the donkeys are one of the last vestiges of the roaring industry which helped build the British Empire, along with the dozens of centuries-old sugar mills which pepper the landscape.
" One place the amiable creatures can find refuge is at Antigua's Donkey Sanctuary in Bethesda, which has become a popular tourist attraction.

            Man who composed hymns from leper colony

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
In our series of letters from African journalists, novelist and writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani writes about the Nigerian man who composed some 200 hymns, despite having leprosy.
Nigeria's most famous victim of leprosy was fatally injured in a motor accident 40 years ago, and a ceremony is being held to mark the anniversary of the music composer's death.
Born in 1905, Ikoli Harcourt Whyte was diagnosed with leprosy as a teenager, at a time when there was no effective cure for the dreaded disease which usually leads to deformity of the hands and feet.
People suffering from leprosy were often isolated or driven away from their communities.
"He wrote with the stubs of his thumb and index finger," said 77-year-old Achinivu Kanu Achinivu, a professor of music who was a friend and protégé of Whyte.
" Listen to his hymn Atula Egwu: End of Youtube post by uchewali86 Whyte's talent for music was developed at the Uzuakoli Leprosy Centre in what is now Abia State in south-eastern Nigeria, where he spent the last 45 years of his life.
Before then, he had been receiving treatment at a hospital in Port Harcourt, capital city of his home state of Rivers in the Niger Delta, which had a thriving leprosy ward.
"It was the place where the dosage of dapsone for treating of leprosy was standardised in the early 1950s, and the first clinical trials of clofazimine took place there in the early 1960s - these are two of the drugs that are used as part of multi-drug therapy for leprosy today.
During trips to surrounding and remote villages to treat leprosy patients, Dr Davey recorded the traditional music of the people.
Even after Whyte was eventually declared cured of leprosy in 1949, he chose to remain at the Uzuakoli centre, where he formed a choir made up of other patients.
His first wife, who also had leprosy, had abandoned him there a few years earlier after she was cured, leaving him with their two children.
Now in his 70s, Mr Okoroafor is currently the oldest resident at the Uzuakoli centre, having been diagnosed with leprosy as a child and abandoned by his family.

            How Russia's high-tech start-ups are looking beyond oil

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
Oil and gas form the bedrock of Russia's economy and swings in world energy prices can push the country from boom to bust.
But can Russia diversify?
In a crowded lobby of an office building near the centre of Moscow, between a fish tank and a hamster cage, Denis is strapping on a robotic skeleton.
The exo-skeleton he is demonstrating is made by ExoAtlet, one of Russia's new breed of tech companies, a sector that the Russian government hopes will help move the economy away from its reliance on energy.
Russia is a country rich in natural resources with an abundance of hydrocarbons such as oil and gas and this is what the economy is based on.
"We in Russia literally do not have presidents being people, it's oil being the president of Russia," says Andrey Movchan, an independent economist at the Moscow Carnegie Centre think tank.
" This reliance on oil is underlined by Russia's exports, 80% of which are directly related to hydrocarbons, according to Mr Movchan.
For the ministers, for the government and for the president the situation in Russia is very stable and very good.
" Russia is emerging from two years of recession.
On top of that the US and EU imposed economic sanctions on Russia following its annexation of Crimea in 2014.

How do you know if the photographs and video footage that you see on social media after an attack are real?
In the absence of concrete facts, many people - and news organisations - turn to social media for information.
The deadly attack on the al-Rawda mosque in Egypt's North Sinai province, which killed at least 235 people, was no different.
In its immediate aftermath, news site Al-Araby shared a dramatic image of crowds outside a smoking building.

            Mugabe and me: A personal history of growing up in Zimbabwe

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
As Zimbabweans usher in a new era, author Petina Gappah considers the long shadow ex-president Robert Mugabe has cast over her life.
" Then the song that all the township children came to know so well, the closest we would get to war: "Kune nzira dzamasoja dzekuzvibatanadzo.
It was far from our family in the township of Glen Norah in Salisbury, but the war came to us every night as my father Tererayi Mureri fiddled with our radio receiver to catch the shortwave transmission from Radio Mozambique.
It was through this transmission that Robert Mugabe came into my life, and entered my imagination as the embodiment of the struggle.
After the elections in March 1980, I sat with my parents and younger siblings as Mugabe addressed us again, this time on television as prime minister of our new country.
In my simplified understanding of the world then, I thought it was purely thanks to Mugabe that my parents were able to buy a new house in a former whites-only suburb that had a library with more books than I could have dreamt of.
In my mind, I associated Mugabe with these riches.
I learned more about Mugabe the guerrilla in history lessons at secondary school.
I poured over the black and white pictures of Mugabe and other independence leaders.
As we walked to the university's Great Hall, another student, Eric Mvududu, approached President Mugabe with a petition.
By the time I came face to face with Mugabe at my own graduation four years later, I was no longer a believer.

            How INXS Kick-started their career

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
Five albums into their career, INXS had clawed their way up from Australia's pub circuit to the US top five.
But no one was prepared for the success of their sixth album, Kick, a sensuous blend of funk, rock and pop that sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.
Heralded by the slinky single Need You Tonight, Kick finally broke the band in the UK, and made a star of singer Michael Hutchence.
According to the band's manager, Chris Murphy, he had a nailbiting encounter with Atlantic Records president Doug Morris when he first took the album to New York.
" Luckily, wiser heads prevailed, and Kick produced an enviable four top 40 hits in the UK - Need You Tonight, New Sensation, Never Tear Us Apart and Mystify (a fifth, Devil Inside, narrowly missed the chart).
As the album turns 30, INXS keyboard player and chief songwriter Andrew Farriss looks back at the making of the album.
INXS started in 1977 as a plucky pub band, with Michael Hutchence joining his schoolfriend Andrew Farriss on stage with his brothers, Tim and Jon.
" Original Sin gave INXS their first number one in Australia, prompting them to pursue a fusion of pop and funk on their next album, Listen Like Thieves.
"What You Need led to us being very confident on Kick and to say, 'Let's put this on a plaque, nail it to the wall and call it our own thing'," says Farriss.
" Previous INXS albums had featured contributions from all six members of the band.
" INXS were insistent that these new songs could be played live before they were recorded so, after reconvening in Australia in late 1986, they hired out the orchestra room beneath the Sydney Opera House.

            Honduras elections: Security key issue as Hernández runs again

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
President Juan Orlando Hernández has governed Honduras since January 2014 and hopes that on Sunday voters will re-elect him for another four-year term.
An incumbent running for re-election would not raise eyebrows in most other countries but it has caused consternation among some in Honduras.
Critics of President Hernández said it was unfair that he should "get away" with changing the constitution when the sheer proposal of a vote on the issue had cost Mr Zelaya his job just a few years earlier.
Despite vociferous protests, Mr Hernández said he planned to seek re-election and in March his National Party chose him as their candidate in the party's primary.
Eight other candidates are standing against President Hernández.

            Mongolia domestic violence: 'I screamed for help, but nobody came'

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
In Mongolia, where one in three families suffer abuse at home but find huge obstacles to seeking help, domestic violence was made a criminal offence this year.
Journalist Grace Brown met with one woman in the capital Ulan Bator who described her traumatic journey from abuse to safety.
"He was perfect," said 36-year-old Tserenhand as she recalled how she met her husband for the first time in 2004 as first-year students at the Law Enforcement University of Ulan Bator.
" Over the next 13 years, Tserenhand, who only wishes to be identified by her first name, says she was raped and beaten by her husband, including in front of their three children.
" One in three families in Mongolia are affected by domestic violence, according to the National Center Against Violence (NCAV), with women such as Tserenhand and their children making up 90% of victims.
The newly-amended Law to Combat Domestic Violence (LCDV) - which entered into force on 1 February, 2017 - for the first time classifies domestic violence a criminal offence.
Under the new law, domestic violence in the first instance still only leads to fines and warnings but the second instance will be treated under the criminal code.
This compels police to investigate reported cases of domestic violence - including physical, sexual, economic abuse, as well as stalking.
"After a domestic violence call, police must enter the grounds where the violence is allegedly taking place, assess the safety of family members, assess the situation, assess the level of danger towards the victim" and "provide safety to all victims".

            Israel and Saudi Arabia: What's shaping the covert 'alliance'

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
To all intents and purposes, Saudi Arabia and Israel are de facto allies in the struggle against Iran's rising influence in the region.
Last week Israel's Chief of Staff, General Gadi Eisenkot, said in an interview with UK-based Saudi newspaper Elaph, that Israel was ready to exchange intelligence with the Saudis in order to confront Iran.
A few days later, speaking after a conference in Paris, a former Saudi justice minister, Dr Muhammad bin Abdul Karim Issa - a close associate of the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - told the Israeli newspaper Maariv that "no act of violence or terror that tries to justify itself by invoking the religion of Islam is justified anywhere, including in Israel".
And just the other day a former senior Israeli military figure speaking in London told of two recent meetings with senior Saudi princes, both of whom said to him words to the effect that, "you are not our enemy any more".
They are carefully co-ordinated and intended to warn Iran of the developing relationship as well as to prepare Saudi society given the likelihood that such ties may become ever more apparent.
The destruction of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq in 2003 by a US-led coalition removed a Sunni Arab strategic counterweight to Shia Iran.
So the enmity between Iran and Saudi Arabia is both strategic and religious.
So a strengthening of the relationship between Israel and Saudi Arabia makes sense to both countries.
However welcome many of the president's words may be in Israel and Saudi Arabia, both governments know that US policy seems adrift in the region.

Many of us assume that if you call an emergency number like 911, 999 or 112, someone will answer quickly and help will arrive soon wherever we are in the world.
In Kenya's capital Nairobi, for example, there are more than 50 different numbers for emergency services.
"You just take for granted that 911 [the US emergency services number] exists, and we did as well," says Caitlin Dolkart.
"We thought - what would we do in an emergency?
The pair created an Uber-style online platform that aims to connect people to the closest emergency responders.
"Within the system we have different ambulance companies, so depending on the resources we work together," says Patrick Kinyenje, who works as emergency co-ordinator or dispatcher at Care Hospital in Nairobi.
It also incorporates Google maps traffic data to help emergency workers navigate the city's notorious traffic jams.
"The membership product is like your emergency and healthcare concierge," says Ms Rabinovich.

            What is on the wish list of women in India PM Modi's hometown?

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
Since becoming India's prime minister in 2014, Narendra Modi has consistently promoted his government's pet campaign to clean up the country.
BBC Hindi's Priyanka Dubey travelled to Mr Modi's hometown to see how it had progressed under the scheme, and found out the one thing that women there want - toilets.
As I approached the town of Vadnagar in the western Indian state of Gujarat, the glitter and shine of the government's most ambitious flagship scheme Swachh Bharat Abhiyan or "Clean India Mission" felt dim.
Vadnagar, a municipality situated in Gujarat's Mehsana district, is where Mr Modi was born and spent his early childhood.
The fact that Rohit Vaas still has two separate defecation grounds for men and women demonstrates that the benefits of a 10.9mn rupee (about $168,800; £126,700) fund allocated for building toilets in rural areas have not reached parts of Mr Modi's own village.

            The citizenship saga hampering Australia’s government

          </div>

          <div class="news-body">

            <p class="summary-content">
The Australian parliament's current fixation with dual-nationality MPs has meant that other pressing matters, including debate about the country's minimum wage and a possible inquiry into banking, are currently on the backburner.
" The parting words of the outspoken Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie, an independent, lamenting her Scottish heritage, which has led to her exit from the Australian parliament after it was discovered she had both Australian and British citizenship.
The constitution bars dual nationals from federal political office and, so far, nine MPs, including the former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, have either resigned or been ruled ineligible by the High Court of Australia.
" The joint citizenship saga, described in the Australian newspaper as "a crazy conga line slicing through our politics and institutions", has cost the centre-right government its majority in the lower house of parliament, though Australia's Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has said there is no question of an early election, because he has the support of two independent MPs.
Ignorance of her entitlements couldn't save her after Australia's highest court in October rejected pleas from other MPs, including Mr Joyce, that at the time of last year's election they didn't know they were dual nationals.
And, he adds: "There are still serious doubts about a number of MPs.

The latest topic to consume a nation of lexicologists is "inclusive writing".
This is the attempt to erase all trace of sexism in a language where gender is a central feature - French nouns are either masculine or feminine, dictating all adjectives and some verbal forms (a point that is sometimes made painfully clear to foreigners who happen to get those wrong).
French people now often talk about "la juge" or "la ministre".
In French, 10 sisters and one brother are collectively "heureux" - happy in a masculine way.

            The unknown Indian woman doctor on Google Doodle

            <p class="summary-content">
Google surprised Indians on Wednesday, when it published a Google Doodle of Rakhmabai Raut, one of British India's earliest practising women doctors, to commemorate the 153rd anniversary of her birth.
This had many in India asking who was Rakhmabai Raut?
Raut became a doctor when modern medicine was in its infancy, which is noteworthy.
Raut was born in Mumbai (then Bombay) in 1864.
Undeterred, Raut took her husband to court, where the two were engaged in a long legal battle over the status of their marriage.
